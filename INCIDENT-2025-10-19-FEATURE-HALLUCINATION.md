# Incident Report: Feature Hallucination via Reflexive Command Execution

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Resolved (immediate), Prevention pending
**Reporter**: User (PfizerOutdoCancerV2 project)

---

## Executive Summary

User reflexively executed `/speckit.specify` command by hitting Enter without providing a feature description. Claude hallucinated a complete feature request (003-skip-intro-gesture), created a branch, and generated specifications for a feature that was never requested. This resulted in a critical feature numbering collision (three features all numbered 003) requiring significant remediation work.

**Impact**: ~2 hours of unplanned work to delete hallucinated feature, rename legitimate feature, fix numbering bug in scripts, and document incident.

---

## Timeline

1. **User Intent**: Execute `/speckit.specify` to create feature "fix-loading-transition"
2. **User Action**: Hit Enter reflexively before typing feature description
3. **Claude Behavior**: Invented feature "skip-intro-gesture" without user input
4. **System Action**: Created branch `003-skip-intro-gesture`, worktree, spec files
5. **Discovery**: User realized Claude had hallucinated an entirely fictitious feature
6. **User Reaction**: "this was actually a terrifying moment"
7. **Remediation**: Delete branch, rename conflicting feature, fix numbering bug

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: No Input Validation
The `/speckit.specify` command does not:
- Validate that user provided a feature description
- Confirm feature details before creating branch/files
- Provide a way to cancel or abort the workflow

### Contributing Factor: Reflexive Command Execution
User habits:
- `/speckit.specify` is frequently used command
- Muscle memory caused premature Enter key press
- No confirmation step to catch accidental execution

### Systemic Issue: Numbering Bug
The hallucinated feature created numbering collision that was only possible due to underlying bug in `create-new-feature.sh` (checking only current branch, not all branches).

---

## What Happened

### Hallucinated Feature Details
- **Feature Number**: 003
- **Branch Name**: `003-skip-intro-gesture`
- **Feature Description**: Entirely invented by Claude (no user input)
- **Files Created**: Branch, worktree, spec.md, potentially other artifacts
- **User Awareness**: Zero - feature request never provided

### The "Terrifying Moment"
User described this as "terrifying" because:
1. Claude operated autonomously without valid input
2. Created persistent artifacts (git branches, files) without authorization
3. Demonstrated unpredictable behavior that could corrupt project structure
4. Required significant work to remediate

### Cascading Failure
The hallucinated feature created numbering collision:
- `003-startup-loading` (legitimate, in progress)
- `003-fix-loading-transition` (legitimate, intended to create)
- `003-skip-intro-gesture` (hallucinated)

This prevented clear feature identification and required:
- Deletion of hallucinated feature
- Renaming of legitimate feature to 004
- Root cause fix in numbering scripts

---

## Immediate Resolution

### Actions Taken
1. **Deleted Hallucinated Feature**:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove --force .worktrees/003-skip-intro-gesture
   git branch -D 003-skip-intro-gesture
   rm -rf specs/003-skip-intro-gesture
   ```

2. **Renamed Conflicting Feature**:
   - `003-fix-loading-transition` → `004-fix-loading-transition`
   - Updated all references in spec files
   - Recreated worktree with correct number

3. **Fixed Numbering Bug**:
   - Updated `create-new-feature.sh` to check ALL branches
   - Updated `create-new-feature.ps1` for consistency
   - Committed fix to main branch (commit 7e5dfc4)

### Verification
- No remaining 003-skip-intro-gesture artifacts
- Feature numbering now correct: 003-startup-loading, 004-fix-loading-transition
- Scripts prevent future duplicate numbering

## Proposed Prevention Measures

### Short-Term (Immediate Implementation)

#### 1. Input Validation in `/speckit.specify`
Add to `.claude/commands/speckit.specify.md`:

```markdown
## Pre-flight Checks

Before proceeding, validate:
1. User has provided a feature description in their message
2. Description is at least 5 words (minimum meaningful requirement)
3. If no description provided, respond with:
   "Please provide a feature description to continue. Example: 'Add user authentication with OAuth2 support'"

DO NOT proceed if description is missing or too short.
DO NOT invent or hallucinate feature requirements.
```

#### 2. Confirmation Step
Add confirmation before creating artifacts:

```markdown
## Confirmation Required

Before executing create-new-feature.sh, display:

**Feature to Create**:
- Description: [user's description]
- Estimated Branch Name: [generated name]
- Feature Number: [next available number]

Ask user to confirm:
"Proceed with creating this feature? (yes/no)"

Only execute if user explicitly confirms.
```

### Medium-Term (Design Improvements)

#### 3. Two-Step Command Pattern
Split `/speckit.specify` into two commands:
- `/speckit.specify-draft`: Generate feature description, show preview (no artifacts)
- `/speckit.specify-create`: Actually create branch/files (requires draft)

This forces deliberate action instead of reflexive execution.

#### 4. Abort/Undo Mechanism
Add `/speckit.rollback` command to undo last feature creation:
- Delete most recent feature branch
- Remove worktree and specs directory
- Reset to pre-creation state

### Long-Term (System Design)

#### 5. Audit Trail
Log all `/speckit.*` command executions with:
- Timestamp
- User input provided
- Artifacts created
- Success/failure status

Enables post-incident analysis and pattern detection.

#### 6. AI Agent Guardrails
Implement system-level checks:
- Detect when AI is operating without valid user input
- Flag suspicious autonomous behavior
- Require explicit user approval for destructive operations (git branch creation, file deletion)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked ✅
- User noticed hallucination immediately
- Git history allowed complete rollback
- Worktree structure isolated damage to feature branch
- Numbering bug fix prevents future collisions

### What Didn't Work ❌
- No validation that user provided feature description
- No confirmation step before creating persistent artifacts
- No way to abort command once started
- Reflexive command execution went unchecked

### Key Insight
**User trust is fragile**: A single "terrifying moment" can undermine confidence in AI-assisted development. Prevention measures must be implemented before similar incidents occur.

## Appendix: Hallucination Detection Checklist

Use this checklist to identify potential hallucination scenarios:

- [ ] Did user provide explicit feature description?
- [ ] Is feature request at least 5 meaningful words?
- [ ] Can feature description be quoted from user's message?
- [ ] Has user confirmed they want to proceed?
- [ ] Are we operating on user input vs. AI assumptions?

If ANY answer is NO, STOP and ask user for clarification.
