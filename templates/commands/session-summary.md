## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The `/speckit.session-summary` command generates a structured markdown file capturing the key information from the current development session. This includes discoveries, decisions, problems solved, files modified, and next steps.

### Command Syntax

```bash
/speckit.session-summary [--type TYPE] [--output PATH] [--format FORMAT]

Options:
  --type TYPE       Session type: feature|bug|research|planning|implementation|general (default: auto-detect)
  --output PATH     Custom output path (default: auto-detect based on feature context)
  --format FORMAT   Output format: markdown|json|yaml (default: markdown)
```

### Execution Flow

1. **Parse Arguments**:
   - Extract `--type`, `--output`, and `--format` flags from user input
   - If `--type` not specified, auto-detect from context (current branch, recent commands)
   - If `--output` not specified, determine save location:
     - If on feature branch (###-feature-name), save to `specs/###-feature-name/session-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
     - If on main/master, save to root directory as `SESSION-YYYY-MM-DD-LEARNINGS.md`
     - For planning phase, suggest `specs/###-feature-name/planning-decisions.md`
     - For implementation phase, suggest `specs/###-feature-name/implementation-notes.md`

2. **Gather Session Context**:
   - Current date and time
   - Feature branch name (if applicable)
   - AI agent being used (Claude, Codex, Factory Droid, etc.)
   - Token usage estimate (from system information if available)
   - Session duration estimate (if possible)
   - Current workflow phase (specify, plan, tasks, implement, general)

3. **Analyze Conversation History** (Review all messages in current session):

   **Key Discoveries Section**:
   - Identify important revelations, insights, or findings
   - Look for phrases like "discovered", "found", "realized", "learned"
   - Extract technical discoveries (bugs, patterns, workarounds)
   - Note impact on feature/project
   - Include file/line references where applicable

   **Problems Solved Section**:
   - Identify errors, bugs, or blockers encountered
   - Extract root causes and solutions applied
   - List files modified to fix each problem
   - Include testing/verification steps taken
   - Reference error messages and log lines

   **Key Decisions Section**:
   - Identify architectural choices made
   - Capture trade-off discussions and final choices
   - Document "why" behind non-obvious decisions
   - Note alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
   - Include constitutional references (if applicable)

   **Files Modified Section**:
   - List all files created or edited
   - Include line ranges for significant changes
   - Brief description of change purpose
   - Link changes to requirements or problems solved

   **Next Steps Section**:
   - Extract explicit TODOs and action items
   - Identify pending decisions or clarifications needed
   - List follow-up work required
   - Note dependencies or blockers
   - Reference related features or issues

4. **Check for Sensitive Information**:
   - Scan generated content for patterns:
     - API keys: `api[_-]?key.*[=:]\s*[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`
     - Tokens: `token.*[=:]\s*[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`
     - Passwords: `password.*[=:]\s*\S+`
     - Private file paths: `/Users/[^/]+/`, `/home/[^/]+/`
   - If sensitive patterns detected:
     - Display warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è Potential sensitive information detected in summary"
     - List pattern types found (not actual values)
     - Recommend review before committing

5. **Generate Output** (Using appropriate format):

   **Markdown Format** (default):
   ```markdown

   **Session Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Feature Branch**: [branch-name or N/A]

       "external": ["Apple Petite Asteroids sample"]
     }
   }
   ```

   **YAML Format** (if --format yaml):
   Similar structure to JSON but in YAML syntax

6. **Write Output File**:
   - Check if output file already exists at target path
   - If exists, prompt user:
     ```
     File already exists: [path]

     Choose action:
       1) Overwrite - Replace existing file
       2) Append timestamp - Save as [filename]-HHMMSS.md
       3) Cancel - Exit without saving

     Your choice (1-3):
     ```
   - Write file to chosen location
   - Set appropriate file permissions

7. **Report Completion**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Session summary generated!

   üìÑ File: [absolute path to output file]
   üìä Captured: [N discoveries, M problems, P decisions]
   üìù Modified files: [count]
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings: [any warnings about sensitive data or issues]

   Next steps:
   - Review file for accuracy and sensitive information
   - Consider adding to git (or .gitignore if contains private paths)
   - Use this file to continue work in a fresh session
   ```

## Auto-Integration with Workflow Commands

The session-summary functionality is automatically integrated into core workflow commands:

- **During `/speckit.specify`**: After completing specification, auto-generate `specs/###-feature/interview.md` containing all Q&A pairs from the specification process
- **During `/speckit.plan`**: After completing planning, auto-generate `specs/###-feature/planning-decisions.md` containing architecture choices, tech stack decisions, and trade-offs
- **During `/speckit.implement`**: After completing implementation, auto-generate `specs/###-feature/implementation-notes.md` containing task completion details, problems solved, and code locations

These auto-generated files use the same structure as manual session summaries but are filtered to include only information relevant to that workflow phase.

## Token Usage Warning

Monitor token usage throughout the session:

- **At 80% token usage**: Display warning message:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Token Usage Warning: 80% of context limit reached

  Consider running /speckit.session-summary to capture session learnings before context loss.

  Current usage: ~800,000 / 1,000,000 tokens
  Remaining: ~200,000 tokens
  ```

- **At 95% token usage**: Auto-generate emergency summary:
  ```
  üö® CRITICAL: Token limit approaching (95%)

  Auto-generating emergency session summary...

  ‚úÖ Summary saved to: [path]

  Recommend starting fresh session and loading this summary for context.
  ```

## Edge Cases

- **Empty or routine session**: If analysis finds no significant discoveries, decisions, or problems, generate minimal summary with note:
  ```markdown
  # Session Summary: [Date]

  **Note**: This session contained primarily routine work with no major discoveries, decisions, or problems documented.

  ## Files Modified

  [List modified files]

  ## Next Steps

  [Extract any TODOs mentioned]
  ```

- **Multiple features in single session**: If user worked on multiple feature branches, prompt:
  ```
  Multiple features detected in session:
  - 002-agent-installer
  - 003-startup-loading

  Select target(s) for summary:
    1) 002-agent-installer only
    2) 003-startup-loading only
    3) Both (generate separate summaries)
    4) General (root directory, cross-feature)

  Your choice (1-4):
  ```

- **Sensitive information detected**: Display warning before writing:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è SENSITIVE INFORMATION DETECTED

  The summary contains potential sensitive patterns:
  - API keys or tokens (2 occurrences)
  - Private file paths (5 occurrences)

  Recommendations:
  - Review file before committing to git
  - Consider adding to .gitignore if contains credentials
  - Redact sensitive values before sharing with team

  Proceed with writing file? (y/n):
  ```

## Quality Guidelines

When generating session summaries:

1. **Be Specific**: Include file:line references, not just file names
2. **Capture Context**: Explain "why" decisions were made, not just "what"
3. **Preserve Evidence**: Quote error messages, log lines, and key user statements
4. **Link to Artifacts**: Reference related specs, plans, tasks, and constitution articles
5. **Structure for Reuse**: Make it easy for fresh AI session to load and continue work
6. **Minimize Noise**: Exclude trivial edits, formatting changes, and routine operations
7. **Highlight Impact**: Emphasize discoveries and decisions that affect multiple features or projects
